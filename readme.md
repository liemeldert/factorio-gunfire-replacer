# Factorio Gunfire Replacer

Simple mod that replaces gunfire noise in factorio with any other ogg vorbis of your choice.
Perfect if you don't like/are triggererd by gunfire sounds.
I used to play with the volume off because of these noises following a certain event happening at my school.

By default, it's replaced with sound/quack.ogg
However, you can change this in the mod settings.

I've included (bad) translations for options into korean, english, spanish, and german.
